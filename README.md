> A simple script written in Python 3.10 capable of performing an arp spoofing operation towards a given local ip address and interrupting its internet network flow, blocking access to it

## Install

To use the script via python, you need to download the source and go to the folder where the "requirements.txt" file is located.<br/>
Here you will need to execute the following command:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If you want to use the script on Windows, there will be an executable file in the repository releases (will need to be run as an administrator).

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you will need to run the script and specify the various parameters.<br/>
* <b>gateway_ip</b> â†’ <i>Default gateway IP</i><br/>
* <b>ip_address</b> â†’ <i>IP address of the victim present on the network</i>
```sh
python arp_spoofer.py -g <gateway_ip> -i <ip_address>
```
As soon as the command is sent, the script starts running and will block the connection for that particular IP address as long as it is running.<br/>
To cancel everything and restore the connection, you will need to press <b>CTRL+C</b> and consequently exit the script
